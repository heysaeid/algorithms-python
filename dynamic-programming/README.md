# Fibonacci sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1. In other words, the sequence goes:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

The Fibonacci sequence can be defined recursively as:

F(n) = 0, if n = 0
F(n) = 1, if n = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), if n > 1

where F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number.
