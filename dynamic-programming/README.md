# Fibonacci sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1. In other words, the sequence goes:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

The Fibonacci sequence can be defined recursively as:

F(n) = 0, if n = 0
F(n) = 1, if n = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), if n > 1

where F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number.

# Maximum Subarray Sum
The Maximum Subarray Sum problem is a well-known problem in computer science that involves finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a given array of integers. This problem can be solved using an efficient algorithm called the Kadane's algorithm.

The time complexity of the Kadane's algorithm for finding the maximum subarray sum is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
