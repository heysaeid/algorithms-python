# Linear search
The linear search algorithm is a simple search algorithm that checks each element of a list or array one by one until it finds the target element.

The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because in the worst case, the algorithm will have to check every element in the array before finding the target (or determining that the target is not in the array). Therefore, as the size of the array grows, the time it takes to perform a linear search will also grow linearly.
