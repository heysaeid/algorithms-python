#Bubble Sort(Babel)
The Bubble sort algorithm, also known as the Babel sort algorithm, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

The time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array.

This is because the algorithm uses nested loops to compare and swap adjacent elements. In the worst-case scenario, where the array is already sorted in reverse order, the algorithm would need to make n^2 comparisons and swaps to sort the array.

Additionally, the algorithm always performs n-1 passes over the array, even if the array is already sorted, which makes it inefficient for large arrays.

For small arrays or arrays that are almost sorted, the bubble sort algorithm may perform reasonably well. However, for larger arrays, more efficient sorting algorithms such as quicksort or mergesort are preferred, as they have a better average-case and worst-case time complexity.

# Merge Sort
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array. It divides the array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the two sorted halves back together.

The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n) in the average and worst cases.

The merge sort algorithm divides the input array into two halves recursively until there is only one element in each half, which takes O(log n) time. Then it merges the two sorted halves back together, which takes O(n) time. Since the merge operation is performed on two halves of roughly equal size, the merge operation takes O(n) time.

Therefore, the total time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n), as the algorithm splits the array into roughly equal halves log n times, and each of these log n levels requires O(n) time to merge the subarrays.

In the best case, where the input array is already sorted, the time complexity of merge sort is still O(n log n), as the algorithm still needs to divide and merge the array.

Overall, the merge sort algorithm provides a very efficient way of sorting arrays and is widely used in practice due to its stability, scalability, and ability to handle large datasets.

# Quicksort
The quicksort algorithm is a popular sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy. It works by selecting a pivot element from the input array and partitioning the array into two subarrays: one subarray with elements smaller than the pivot and another subarray with elements larger than the pivot. The algorithm then recursively sorts the two subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average, where n is the length of the input array. However, in the worst case (when the pivot element is the smallest or largest element in the array), the time complexity can be O(n^2). Nonetheless, quicksort is still a very efficient sorting algorithm for most input sizes and is widely used in practice.

# Insertion Sort
The insertion sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building the final sorted array one element at a time. It does this by iterating over each element in the array and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted subarray to the left.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the input array. However, it has a best-case time complexity of O(n) when the input array is already sorted, and it has a space complexity of O(1) since it sorts the array in place. Despite its quadratic time complexity, insertion sort is still useful for small input sizes or for situations where the input is almost sorted.

# Selection Sort
Selection sort is a simple, comparison-based sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm divides the input array into two parts: a sorted subarray which starts empty and grows with each iteration, and an unsorted subarray which contains all the remaining elements. The algorithm then selects the smallest element from the unsorted subarray and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted subarray. This effectively moves the smallest element to its correct position in the sorted subarray, and reduces the size of the unsorted subarray by 1. The process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, which makes it relatively inefficient for large arrays. However, it has the advantage of being simple and easy to implement, making it a good choice for small arrays or as a teaching tool for introductory computer science courses.

# Radix Sort
Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts elements by processing individual digits in each element. It can be used to sort integers or strings of characters, and it sorts them by grouping digits or characters by place value.
